## Overview

Banking Risk Analysis is a project aimed at identifying, quantifying, and visualizing risk patterns in banking data. By analyzing customer account details and transaction history, the goal is to detect anomalies, predict risky behavior, and provide insights useful for financial institutions’ decision making.

---

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of transaction & customer account datasets  
- Risk scoring or anomaly detection (depending on model / method)  
- Integration with Power BI to present interactive dashboards  
- Visualizations to highlight trends and risk indicators  
- (Optional) Predictive models to forecast risk scenarios  

---

## Repository Structure

Below is an overview of the key files and folders:






You may expand this with subfolders like `data/`, `notebooks/`, `scripts/`, `models/`, etc. as your project grows.

---

## Datasets

- **Banking Transactions Dataset.xlsx**  
  Contains individual transaction records. Columns might include: transaction ID, date, amount, account ID, merchant, transaction type, etc.

- **Customer Account Details.xlsx**  
  Contains customer-level information: customer ID, account opening date, credit score, account balance, demographics, etc.

Make sure to inspect and document the column names, data types, missing values, and any preprocessing steps (e.g. normalization, missing value imputation).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You’ll need:

- Python 3.x  
- Common data science / ML libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib / seaborn, scikit-learn, etc.)  
- Power BI Desktop (if you want to open/edit the `.pbix` dashboard file)  

You might also use Jupyter / JupyterLab or VS Code / PyCharm for development.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ronix07/banking-risk-analysis.git
    cd banking-risk-analysis
    ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # (on Linux / macOS)
    # or
    venv\Scripts\activate     # (on Windows)
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   If `requirements.txt` doesn’t exist yet, you can manually install:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```

### Usage

1. Open a Jupyter notebook or Python script to load and explore the data:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    transactions = pd.read_excel("Banking Transactions Dataset.xlsx")
    customers = pd.read_excel("Customer Account Details.xlsx")

    # perform EDA, cleaning, modeling, etc.
    ```

2. Run your analyses, generate risk scores or anomaly flags.

3. Visualize results or export cleaned / processed data.

4. Open **Financial Bank Power Bi Dashboard.pbix** in Power BI Desktop to view or modify the dashboard visualizations.

## Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard file (`.pbix`) contains prebuilt visualizations of key metrics and risk indicators. The included PNG (`Power Bi Dashboard Image.png`) is a static snapshot of the dashboard. Use these visuals for presentation or further customization.
